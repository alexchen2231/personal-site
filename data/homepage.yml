  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    As a sophomore studying computer science and economics, I am interested in both 
    building robust tools and solving high-level business problems. I love working in teams
    where I can wear many hats, adapting and using both technical non-technical skills
    to tackle new challenges. For my future career, I am interested in opportunities 
    in consulting, product management, and software engineering.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Outside of coursework, I work in a lab in the Yale School of Public Health,
    I play on the Yale Mens Club Volleyball Team, I lead a team in Helix (an undergraduate healthcare tech
    incubator), and I help coordinate art exhibitions as Events Chair for Art Exhibition Students at Yale.

    content: '<p class="lead">
    My internship with Wayfair was recently cancelled, so I am actively 
    re-recruiting for summer 2020. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Additionally, I am taking <a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&q=EDUC+302%3A+Behavior+Design&collapse=" target="_blank">
    EDUC 302 Behavior Design for Coronavirus Challenges</a>, a course
    taught at Stanford by <a href="https://www.bjfogg.com/" target="_blank">BJ Fogg</a>. Because of the global 
    nature of the course topic for this year, the class was open to non-Stanford students to apply.
    After submitting an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSBX4tcdZHo" target="_blank">audition project</a> 
    I was lucky enough to be accepted, and 
    now I am working on a variety of projects that harness the power of behavior design 
    to solve some of the more personal problems people are facing due to the pandemic.
    For example, my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bEIYd4IEjc" target="_blank">personal project</a> 
    utilized anchor behaviors in my own life to prompt 
    me to call my grandparents every day and keep in touch.
